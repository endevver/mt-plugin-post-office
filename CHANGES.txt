Changelog for Post Office
==========================

Version 1.1
-----------

* Added support for #hashtag parsing for subject line (applies tags to entry).
* Assigns any author's text format as the text format for the entry; falls back to blog's default text format.
* Specifying IgnoreSizeError option with IMAPClient; seems Gmail reported size doesn't necessarily match content length?


Version 1.0
-----------

* Initial release.
